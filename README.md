# Kosisochukwu Allison Submission

This project was bootstarapped with [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/). Yes I could have used
[craco](https://craco.js.org/) but there isn't much custom configuration needed  to be done. The 
project wouldn't win the award for UI but it's performance is very decent.
